A concise, LLM-optimized reference for the [Squam programming language](https://github.com/Squ-am/squam-lang).

## Why?
LLMs learn better from:
- Concrete examples over verbose explanations
- Consistent patterns and structure
- High information density

This reference prioritizes **knowledge-to-token ratio** - maximum learning with minimum context window usage.

## Usage

### For LLM tools
Point your LLM coding assistant to this repo or include the reference in your system prompt.

### For RAG systems
The markdown structure makes it easy to chunk and embed for retrieval-augmented generation.

### Direct context
Copy `squam.md` into your conversation when asking an LLM to write Squam code.
